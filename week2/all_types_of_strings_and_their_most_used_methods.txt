The difference between string bulider and string buffer
StringBuilder and StringBuffer are both classes in Java used to create mutable sequences of characters. However, there are some key differences between the two:
1. Synchronization:
   - StringBuffer is synchronized, which means it is thread-safe and can be used in a multi-threaded environment without additional synchronization.
   - StringBuilder is not synchronized, making it faster than StringBuffer in single-threaded environments but not thread-safe.
2. Performance:
   - StringBuilder generally offers better performance than StringBuffer due to the lack of synchronization overhead.  
3. Use Cases:
   - Use StringBuffer when working in a multi-threaded environment where thread safety is a concern.
   - Use StringBuilder in single-threaded applications where performance is critical.
In summary, choose StringBuffer for thread-safe operations and StringBuilder for better performance in single-threaded scenarios.
Most used methods of StringBuilder and StringBuffer 
Both StringBuilder and StringBuffer share many of the same methods since they both extend the AbstractStringBuilder class. Here are some of the most commonly used methods:
1. append(String str): Appends the specified string to the end of the current sequence.
2. insert(int offset, String str): Inserts the specified string at the specified position.
3. delete(int start, int end): Removes the characters in a substring of the sequence.
4. deleteCharAt(int index): Removes the character at the specified position.
5. replace(int start, int end, String str): Replaces the characters in a substring  
6. reverse(): Reverses the sequence of characters.
7. toString(): Converts the StringBuilder or StringBuffer to a String.
8. length(): Returns the length of the character sequence.
9. capacity(): Returns the current capacity of the character sequence.
10. setLength(int newLength): Sets the length of the character sequence.
These methods allow for efficient manipulation of character sequences in both StringBuilder and StringBuffer.
    of the sequence with the specified string.  
The detailed explanation of the regrex method in string ie library
The regex (regular expression) methods in the Java String class are used for pattern matching and manipulation of strings based on specific patterns. Here are some of the most commonly used regex methods in the String class:
1. matches(String regex): This method checks if the entire string matches the specified regular expression. It returns true if the string matches the regex, otherwise false.
Example:
String str = "hello";
boolean result = str.matches("h.*o"); // returns true
2. split(String regex): This method splits the string into an array of substrings based on the specified regular expression.
Example:
String str = "apple,banana,cherry";
String[] fruits = str.split(","); // returns ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
3. replaceAll(String regex, String replacement): This method replaces all occurrences of the substring that match the specified regular expression with the given replacement string.
Example:
String str = "The cat sat on the mat.";
String newStr = str.replaceAll("cat", "dog"); // returns "The dog sat on the mat."
4. replaceFirst(String regex, String replacement): This method replaces the first occurrence of the substring that matches the specified regular expression with the given replacement string.
Example:
String str = "The cat sat on the mat.";
String newStr = str.replaceFirst("cat", "dog"); // returns "The dog sat on the mat."
5. find(): This method is part of the Matcher class (not directly in String) and is used to find occurrences of the pattern in the input string.
Example:
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("cat");
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("The cat sat on the mat.");
while (matcher.find()) {
    System.out.println("Found at: " + matcher.start()); 
}
These regex methods provide powerful tools for string manipulation and pattern matching in Java.
with the specified string.
6. reverse(): Reverses the sequence of characters.
7. toString(): Converts the StringBuilder or StringBuffer to a String.
8. length(): Returns the length of the character sequence.
9. capacity(): Returns the current capacity of the character sequence.
10. setLength(int newLength): Sets the length of the character sequence.
These methods allow for efficient manipulation of character sequences in both StringBuilder and StringBuffer.
