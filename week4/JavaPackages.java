/*
    A package in Java is a mechanism to group related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages into a single unit. Packages help organize large applications, avoid naming conflicts, provide access protection, and make code modular and maintainable.

Avoiding name conflicts (two classes with the same name can exist in different packages)
Providing access control using public, protected, and default access
Reusability: packaged code can be imported and used anywhere
Encouraging modular programming


1. Built-in Packages
Built-in Packages comprise a large number of classes that are part of the Java API. Some of the commonly used built-in packages are:

java.lang: Contains language support classes(e.g, classes that define primitive data types, math operations). This package is automatically imported.
java.io: Contains classes for supporting input/output operations.
java.util: Contains utility classes that implement data structures such as Linked Lists and Dictionaries, as well as support for date and time operations.
java.applet: Contains classes for creating Applets.
java.awt: Contains classes for implementing the components for graphical user interfaces (like buttons, menus, etc). 6)

2. User-defined Packages
User-defined Packages are the packages that are defined by the user.

public class GFG{
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // using Random class
        Random rand = new Random();   

        // generates a number between 0–99
        int number = rand.nextInt(100);  

        System.out.println("Random number: " + number);
    }
}

// illustrating the user defined functions
// package com.myapp; ------> we will be stating that this class i going to be imported in other classes

public class Helper {
    public static void show() {
        System.out.println("Hello from Helper!");
    }
}
// now using the package we we made
// import com.myapp.Helper;----->importing our user defined package

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Helper.show();
    }

public class JavaPackages {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("This code is just a hint of the java packages i will be using in the future\n so just get familia with them ");
