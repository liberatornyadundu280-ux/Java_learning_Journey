***** Collections in java********
collections are data structures which store our data and are treated as a unit ie one object
In java there are treated as a Hierarchy  of interfaces where some interfaces inherite another interface 
**** Why did inheriting was done
--> to make the coding short for developers 
--> reduce complexity of codes as they will be implementing the same interface with common methods ef add,remove and clear.
list of interfaces in their Hierarchy starting with the top one .
1 itteratable ----> remove, add, clear
2 Collections=====> lastly explained 
3 list---> implemented by 1 arraylist
                          2 list
                          3 stack -->push,pop
                          4 vector
                          5 linkedlist
4 queue---> implemented by all types of queue
5 set ---> implemented by all types of sets ie sortedset, hashset, 
****METHODSin Collections interface********
add(Object)	----> This method is used to add an object to the collection.
addAll(Collection c)----> This method adds all the elements in the given collection to this collection.
clear()	---->This method removes all of the elements from this collection.
contains(Object o)	----> This method returns true if the collection contains the specified element.
containsAll(Collection c)	----> This method returns true if the collection contains all of the elements in the given collection.
equals(Object o)	----> This method compares the specified object with this collection for equality.
hashCode()	----> This method is used to return the hash code value for this collection.
isEmpty()	----> This method returns true if this collection contains no elements.
iterator()	----> This method returns an iterator over the elements in this collection.
parallelStream()	----> This method returns a parallel Stream with this collection as its source.
remove(Object o)	----> This method is used to remove the given object from the collection. If there are duplicate values, then this method removes the first occurrence of the object.
removeAll(Collection c)		----> This method is used to remove all the objects mentioned in the given collection from the collection.
removeIf(Predicate filter)		----> This method is used to remove all the elements of this collection that satisfy the given predicate.
retainAll(Collection c)	----> 	This method is used to retain only the elements in this collection that are contained in the specified collection.
size()	----> This method is used to return the number of elements in the collection.
spliterator()	----> This method is used to create a Spliterator over the elements in this collection.
stream()	----> This method is used to return a sequential Stream with this collection as its source.
toArray()	----> this method is used to return an array containing all of the elements in this collection.

******* All the implementations of the collections will have similar methods depending on ehich class they belong ***********
